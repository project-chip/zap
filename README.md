## [What is ZAP?](https://docs.silabs.com/zap-tool/1.0.0/zap-start/)

ZAP is a generic generation engine and user interface for applications and libraries based on Zigbee Cluster Library, the specification developed by the [Connectivity Standards Alliance](https://csa-iot.org/).

ZAP allows you to perform the following:

- perform SDK-specific customized generation of all global artifacts (constants, types, IDs, etc) based on the ZCL specification
- provide UI for the end-user to select specific application configuration (clusters, attributes, commands, etc.)
- perform SDK-specific customized generation of all user selected configuration artifacts (application configuration, endpoint configuration, etc) based on ZCL specification and customer-provided application configuration.

ZAP is a generic templating engine. Examples are provided for how to generate artifacts for the C language environment, but one could easily add new templates for other language environments, such as C++, java, node.js, python or any other.
