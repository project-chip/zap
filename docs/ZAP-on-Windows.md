# Install ZAP from Source on Windows

## Windows-specific Prerequisite Settings

**1. Windows Powershell:** 

In desktop search bar, input "Windows Powershell" and run as administrator. Run all the following commands inside Powershell.

**2. Chocolatey:**

Install from https://chocolatey.org/install

Check if installed properly:
```
choco -v
```
Install pkgconfiglite package:
```
choco install pkgconfiglite
```

**3. Install Node if you have not:**
```
choco install nodejs-lts
```
*the version has to be 18 to pass version check test, after install, check with "node -v"

*if you install Node already, and fail some tests similar to "cannot find Node", reinstall Node with chocolatey again

**4. Follow the instruction page for other installation details**

## Fix Possible Error

**1. sqlite3**

When running ZAP (eg. 'npm run zap'), if you see an error about "sqlite3.node" in a pop up window, run:
```
npm rebuild sqlite3
```

**2. electron-builder:**

When doing npm install, in post-install, if there is an error on the following command, related to "electron-builder install-app-deps", "node_modules/canvas" or "node-pre-gyp", it is because the electron-builder is not completely compatible with Windows and the installation error will not cause a failure in running ZAP
```
"postinstall": "electron-builder install-app-deps && husky install && npm rebuild canvas --update-binary && npm run version-stamp"
```

## Fix Failed Tests

**1. Exceed Timeout**

If 'npm run test' fails due to "Exceeded timeout of 1500 ms for a test. Use jest.setTimeout(newTimeout) to increase the timeout value, if this is a long-running test.", set the following environment variables to increase timeouts for all tests.
```
$env:ZAP_TEST_TIMEOUT = 50000000; $env:ZAP_TEST_TIMEOUT_SHORT = 50000000; $env:ZAP_TEST_TIMEOUT_MEDIUM = 50000000; $env:ZAP_TEST_TIMEOUT_LONG = 50000000
```

**2. Test Suite failed to run (Canvas not found)**

If 'npm run test' fails due to "Test suite failed to run. Cannot find module '../build/Release/canvas.node'" or "\zap\node_modules\canvas\build\Release\canvas.node is not a valid Win32 application.", rebuild canvas:
```
npm rebuild canvas --update-binary
```

**3. get index.html or other server issue**

If 'npm run test" fails due to “get index.html request failed with status code 404” in unit tests or having server connection issues in e2e-ci tests, run:
```
npm run build
```

**4. Other**

Check if node version is v18, and try to install it with Chocolatey
