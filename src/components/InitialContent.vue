      <h4 id="what-is-zap-">What is ZAP?</h4>
      <p>
        ZAP is a generic generation engine and user interface for applications
        and libraries based on
        <a
          href="https://zigbeealliance.org/developer_resources/zigbee-cluster-library/"
          >Zigbee Cluster Library</a
        >, the specification developed by the
        <a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/">Zigbee Alliance</a>.
      </p>
      <p>ZAP allows you to perform the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          perform SDK-specific customized generation of all global artifacts
          (constants, types, IDs, etc) based on the ZCL specification
        </li>
        <li>
          provide UI for the end-user to select specific application
          configuration (clusters, attributes, commands, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          perform SDK-specific customized generation of all user selected
          configuration artifacts (application configuration, endpoint
          configuration, etc) based on ZCL specification and customer-provided
          application configuration.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ZAP is a generic templating engine. Examples are provided for how to
        generate artifacts for the C language environment, but one could easily
        add new templates for other language environments, such as C++, java,
        node.js, python or any other.

      <h2 id="quick-instructions">Quick instructions</h2>
      <p>
        This is a node.js application. In order to run it, you need to have
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> installed. The best way is to
        simply download latest install of
        <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">node</a> and you will get npm.
        If you have an older version of node installed on your workstation, it
        may give you trouble, particularly if it&#39;s very old. So make sure
        you have decently recent (v12.x or v14.x should work as of 2021) version
        of node available. Run <code>node --version</code> to check what version
        is picked up.
      </p>
      <p>Once you have a desired version of node, you can run:</p>
      <pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">npm</span> ci
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        which will download install all the project dependencies. It is not
        uncommon to run into native library compilation problems at this point.
        There are various <code>src-script/install-*</code> scripts for
        different platforms. Please refer to <a href="docs/faq.md">FAQ</a> for
        additional details of which script to run on different platforms and
        then rerun <code>npm ci</code>.
      </p>
      <p>Then run:</p>
      <pre><code>npm <span class="hljs-keyword">run</span><span class="bash"> zap</span>
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Refer to
        <a href="docs/instructions.md">more detailed instructions</a> for more
        details.
